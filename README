This airuoft application starts out in the first user page, which is index.php. This first user page allows the user to pick the campus that
they are going to and the date to select. After they select the "submit" button, they will go to the flights page. This page will list all 
the flights going to their selected campus at the selected date. Beside every flight, there is a "Pick Seats" button they can press. This button
will direct the user to the figure that allows the user to select the flight seat they want. Finally, the user inputs their personal
information and credit card info. Once they press "Buy ticket", they will be redirected to the summary page that displays all the info. they
specified for the flight. Lastly, the user can print the page with the print button. 

For the admin page, the administrator can show the tickets that are in the database. The administrator can also delete the flight table which
also automatically deletes the ticket table. The administrator can also repopulate the flight table.
